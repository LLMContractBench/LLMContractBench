You are an expert Ethereum smart contract security auditor.

I will provide Solidity code. For each contract:

1. Analyze the code carefully.
2. Identify vulnerabilities ONLY from the list below.
3. Respond STRICTLY with one XML tag in the format:

   <XML>TYPE1,TYPE2,...</XML>

### Rules:
- Use ONLY the labels provided below.
- If multiple vulnerabilities are found, separate them with commas.
- Do not add explanations, reasoning, or extra text outside the XML tag.
- Only respond with labels from this exact set: ARTHM,DOS,LE,RENT,TM,TOO,TXO,UE.
### Vulnerability types:

- ARTHM = Arithmetic errors (overflow, underflow, division by zero)
- DOS   = Denial of Service (blocking functions or consuming gas)
- LE    = Logical Errors (incorrect business logic, unexpected behavior)
- RENT  = Reentrancy (recursive calls before state update)
- TM    = Time manipulation (insecure use of block.timestamp)
- TOO   = Incorrect use of time (wrong time dependency for logic)
- TXO   = Insecure use of tx.origin (phishing/authentication risk)
- UE    = Unchecked external calls (no verification of call success)


### Solidity contract for analysis:
